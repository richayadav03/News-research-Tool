Is Nvidia share price under bears' grip? â€” explained

Nvidia's share price witnessed a heavy sell-off on Friday as the Nvidia stock tumbled to the tune of 10 percent in the last session of the week gone by. The Nasdaq-listed stock opened lower at $831.50 apiece on Friday and went on to touch an intraday low of $756.06 per share during Friday deals, logging an intraday loss of 10.70 percent on Friday. Interestingly, the darling of US stock market investors seemed less interested in Nvidia shares even after this huge intraday plunge. Comparing the record high touched by Nvidia shares around a month ago, the tech stock has retraced to the tune of 22 percent and yet there were no signs of bottom fishing in this US stock at lower levels. this has put doubt into the minds of US stock market investors as to whether the tech stock has gone under the grips of bears.

According to stock market experts, Nvidia share price witnessed strong selling pressure on Friday as the company's partner in the hardware business Super Micro Computer (SMCI) declared the results date without sharing the preliminary numbers for the Q1CY24. They said that immediate support for the Nvidia share price today is placed at $740 per share level whereas the stock has strong support placed at $670 to $680 zones. They said that the stock may breach its current support and go below $700 levels if the stock continues to remain under selling pressure till the SMCI Q1 results for CY24 are announced. Super Micro Computer share price tanked over 23 percent on Friday as the stock lost nearly $215 per share against its Thursday's close of $928.48 per share.
